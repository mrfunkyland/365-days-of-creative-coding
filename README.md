365-days-of-creative-coding
===========================

Every day for one year I intend to complete one small project in the realm of creative coding. Most of my code will be in PureData, although I would also like to explore audio coding in Python, SuperCollider, and possibly C++.

To run these files (called 'patches' in Pd) you will need to download PureData extended version: http://puredata.info/downloads
